    <h5>Armenian national Tolma recipe</h5>
    <img src="recipes/tolma.jpg" alt="Tolma: is a family of stuffed dishes common in Mediterranean cuisine and surrounding regions including the Balkans, the South Caucasus, Central Asia, India and the Middle East">
    <h6>Ingredients and steps</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g  minced beef</li> and parsley</li>
        <li>150 g  tomato sauce</li>
        <li>15  g  salt</li>
        <li>3   g  black pepper</li>
        <li>300 g  grape leaves</li>
        <li>1      cup plain yoghurt</li>
        <li>15  g  chopped mint</li>
        <li>1      clove chopped garlic for the sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix all ingredients, except rice and grape leaves, well by hand.</li>
        <li>Add rice and mix by hand. For those who don’t eat rice for some reason , they can make it without rice!</li>
        <li>If using fresh grape leaves, cut off the stems and blanch them in boiling water first. But if you are using canned leaves, wash in hot water.</li>
        <li>Next, prep your pot. Place some grape leaves on the bottom of a medium to large pot to prevent the tolma from sticking.</li>
        <li>Now the fun part. Spread a leaf on a plate or cutting board, wrong side up and stem end towards you. Put a teaspoon of filling near the stem end. With your hands fold the sides and then roll up like a cigar.</li>
        <li>Place the rolled dolma in the pot. Layer the dolma in two or three layers.</li>
        <li>To ensure stability, place a plate over the top and fill the pot with 2 cups of water. You can add more tomato sauce for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Heat stove to 150C, and cook for 50 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sauce: yoghurt, mint and garlic mix together. Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
